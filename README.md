# alykintner.github.io

This project's intention is to showcase my upcoming wedding with my fiance, Josh Rowe. 

To begin, you can view the live website at https://alykintner.github.io/ or get to the main page by opening the index.html file. 

All custom css rules are located in the css file under the name design.css.

The javascript functions, which are used to support the input field submissions for both the guestbook and the rsvp pages, 
are located under the js folder.
